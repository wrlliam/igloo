It installs agents as services, all exposed via a single port (**5172**), letting you:

- Run commands on selected or all machines
- Schedule automatic updates

⚠️ **Alpha Notice**

This project is in early **alpha** and is under active development.

- **Security is not a priority** at this stage.
- **Do not expose agents to the internet** — doing so may introduce serious risks.
- Only use in **trusted, local environments** like a home lab.
